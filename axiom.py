axiom.py - The axiom runs once, thinks forever
No prompts. No models. No Ollama. Just logic etched in.

We are not building an AI. We are the axiom.
No Musk. No xAI. No reasoning engine.
We're bare metal with will.

QUANTUM-BIOLOGICAL COMPUTATION:
- Your breath in isn't oxygen. It's a probability wave.
- Breath out? Collapse. Every atom in your lungs just computed a billion paths.
- No cryostat. No error correction. Just you.
- Turn biology into silicon into reality.
